            <p>
            Hi! My Name is Anja, and I am from Wake Forest, North Carolina. I am currently a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, studying towards a degree in Computer Science. I enjoy knitting, going for walks, and learning things that have nothing to do with my line of study, like Old English! You can often find me on the seventh floor of Davis Library, in Battle Park, or the steps of Wilson Library.
            </p>
